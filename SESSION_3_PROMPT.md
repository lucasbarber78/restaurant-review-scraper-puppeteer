# Converting restaurant-review-scraper-puppeteer to Claude-Iterated Memory System - Session 3

In our previous sessions (April 27, 2025), we successfully set up the core Claude-iterated memory system for the restaurant-review-scraper-puppeteer repository and created comprehensive documentation templates and structures.

## Progress So Far

### Session 1 Accomplishments:
1. Established the three-tier memory architecture (Core, Recall, Archival)
2. Created the CLAUDE_MEMORY_GUIDE.md explaining the memory system
3. Set up the memory index structure in memory_index.json
4. Developed core memory documents (project_overview.md, architecture.md, requirements.md, current_status.md, ai_workflow.md)
5. Created initial recall memory with session template and first session summary
6. Established basic archival memory directory structure
7. Added sample archival document for anti-bot measures
8. Updated README.md to reflect the new memory system

### Session 2 Accomplishments:
1. Created a migration tracking document (MIGRATION_TRACKING.md)
2. Developed comprehensive archival documentation for key components:
   - scraper_design.md - Overall scraper architecture
   - data_processing.md - Data extraction and handling
   - proxy_management.md - Proxy rotation strategies
   - browser_fingerprinting.md - Fingerprinting countermeasures
3. Created specialized templates for:
   - Site-specific scraping strategies (site_strategies.md)
   - Configuration documentation (configuration_guide.md)
   - Testing and validation procedures (testing_validation.md)
4. Added READMEs for archival subdirectories (API, Config)
5. Enhanced the memory index with additional component relationships and metadata
6. Created a session summary for Session 2

## Session 3 Goals

For this final session, please help me:

1. **Complete the content migration from legacy documents**:
   - Migrate remaining content from AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md to core/ai_workflow.md
   - Migrate content from FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md to appropriate documents (primarily core/current_status.md)
   - Extract and migrate content from NEXT_STEPS.md to core/current_status.md
   - Migrate content from PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md to core/architecture.md and core/requirements.md
   - Migrate setup instructions from PROJECT_SETUP_README.md to an archival setup document

2. **Create any remaining specialized documentation**:
   - Create an archival/implementation/setup.md document for installation and setup
   - Create an archival/api/api_overview.md document if relevant based on old documentation
   - Add any other specialized documents identified during migration

3. **Integrate memory system with development processes**:
   - Create a claude_memory/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md document explaining how to maintain documentation during development
   - Update the memory index to include all new documents
   - Ensure all documents are properly cross-referenced

4. **Create a documentation maintenance guide**:
   - Develop guidelines for keeping the memory system up-to-date
   - Create examples of common documentation workflows
   - Document indexing best practices

5. **Final verification and cleanup**:
   - Ensure consistent formatting across all documents
   - Verify all links between documents work correctly
   - Update the MIGRATION_TRACKING.md document to reflect completion
   - Create a final session summary in recall memory

The end goal is to have a complete, self-contained Claude-iterated memory system that will serve as the documentation foundation for the project moving forward, with clear processes for maintaining and extending it as the project evolves.

Please provide a plan for tackling these Session 3 tasks and then help me implement them efficiently.
