# Next Steps for Restaurant Review Scraper Puppeteer

## What We've Accomplished

We have developed a comprehensive Restaurant Review Scraper using Puppeteer that can extract and analyze reviews from multiple platforms (TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Google Reviews). The scraper includes multi-client support, robust anti-bot detection evasion techniques, and data categorization capabilities.

## Current Enhancement: Advanced Anti-Bot Detection System

Our current focus is on enhancing the anti-bot detection system to improve reliability and success rate. This involves:

- [ ] Research and implement improved browser fingerprinting techniques
- [ ] Add support for rotating proxies to avoid IP-based detection
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated human-like behavior patterns
- [ ] Create a detection test system to validate evasion techniques
- [ ] Add metrics for detection attempt logging
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when detection occurs
- [ ] Create recovery strategies for interrupted scraping sessions
- [ ] Enhance scrolling behavior with more natural patterns
- [ ] Optimize wait times based on page load indicators
- [ ] Add mouse movement path randomization
- [ ] Implement WebGL randomization techniques
- [ ] Add timezone and locale randomization
- [ ] Create plugin for automated CAPTCHA detection and handling
- [ ] Add support for 2Captcha/Anti-Captcha services
- [ ] Implement browser profile rotation
- [ ] Create detailed logging for detection events
- [ ] Add custom user agent generation

### Tasks in Progress

1. Researching advanced browser fingerprinting prevention techniques
2. Testing proxy rotation implementation
3. Implementing browser profile management

### Next Focus: Proxy Rotation System

In our next session, we will focus specifically on implementing a proxy rotation system to help avoid IP-based detection. Steps include:

1. Adding proxy configuration support to config.yaml
2. Creating a proxy management module
3. Implementing automatic proxy rotation based on usage patterns
4. Adding proxy testing and validation
5. Creating fallback mechanisms for failed proxies

### Future Actions

Once we complete the anti-bot detection enhancements:

1. Implement enhanced data analysis capabilities
2. Add support for additional review platforms
3. Create a web-based dashboard for review analytics
4. Implement scheduled scraping with cron integration
