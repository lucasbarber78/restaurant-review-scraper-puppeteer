# Next Steps for Restaurant Review Scraper

## Recently Completed

We've successfully implemented the unified structure analysis system for TripAdvisor and Yelp:

1. **Platform-Specific Structure Files**
   - ✅ Created `tripadvisor_structure.json` with selectors and anti-bot patterns
   - ✅ Created `yelp_structure.json` with enhanced anti-bot detection measures
   - ✅ Developed a comprehensive schema for structure files including selectors, anti-bot patterns, behavior patterns, and fingerprinting configurations

2. **Unified Structure Analysis Framework**
   - ✅ Created `structure_analyzer.py` module for analyzing and managing structure files
   - ✅ Implemented `StructureManager` class for accessing structure data across different platforms
   - ✅ Developed `update_structure.py` script for managing structure files via command line

3. **Integration with Scraper**
   - ✅ Implemented `tripadvisor_structure_scraper.py` that uses the structure files for dynamic selectors
   - ✅ Added support for applying fingerprinting settings from structure files
   - ✅ Integrated human-like behavior patterns from structure files

## Next Actions

1. **Complete Platform Integration**
   - [ ] Implement Yelp structure scraper
   - [ ] Implement Google structure scraper
   - [ ] Update main.py to use structure-based scrapers

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] Create validation script to test structure files against live websites
   - [ ] Implement automatic structure updating when selectors fail
   - [ ] Add unit tests for structure analyzer and manager

3. **Enhanced Anti-Bot Features**
   - [ ] Implement CAPTCHA detection from structure files
   - [ ] Add proxy rotation support based on structure-defined patterns
   - [ ] Create more sophisticated user behavior simulation

4. **Performance and Reliability**
   - [ ] Add caching layer for structure files
   - [ ] Implement automatic retry with different structure configurations
   - [ ] Add logging and telemetry for structure usage

5. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Create a user interface for structure management
   - [ ] Add visualization for structure analysis results
   - [ ] Implement structure editing capabilities

## Implementation Plan

### Yelp Structure Scraper

The next priority is to implement a Yelp scraper that leverages our structure file:

1. Create `yelp_structure_scraper.py` similar to the TripAdvisor implementation
2. Add enhanced anti-bot techniques specific to Yelp
3. Implement advanced user behavior simulation
4. Add support for Yelp's rate limiting detection
5. Test with various restaurant pages

### Google Structure Scraper

After completing the Yelp implementation:

1. Create Google structure file
2. Implement Google structure scraper
3. Add support for Google Maps' dynamic content loading
4. Handle Google's unique scrolling and pagination

### Main Script Updates

Finally, update the main script to use the new structure-based scrapers:

1. Modify `main.py` to check for structure files
2. Add automatic structure updating if needed
3. Implement a unified interface for all scrapers
4. Add command line options for structure management

## Long-Term Vision

1. **Self-Healing System**
   - Scraper that can automatically adapt to website changes
   - Learn from successful and failed scraping attempts
   - Generate and test new selectors automatically

2. **Extended Platform Support**
   - Add support for more review platforms
   - Create a plugin system for adding new platforms

3. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Implement more sophisticated sentiment analysis
   - Add topic modeling for reviews
   - Create comparative analysis across platforms
