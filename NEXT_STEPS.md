# Next Steps for Restaurant Review Scraper

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully enhanced the Restaurant Review Scraper with multi-client support and a more robust architecture:

1. **Multi-Client Architecture**
   - Implemented `clients.json` for managing multiple restaurant clients
   - Updated the main scraper to support batch processing
   - Created a flexible command-line interface for controlling scraping behavior
   - Updated directory structure for better organization

2. **Structure Analysis System**
   - Developed a sophisticated system for analyzing Google Reviews DOM structure
   - Created a mechanism to adapt to changes in site structure
   - Implemented automatic selector detection for resilient scraping

3. **Enhanced Configuration**
   - Improved the configuration system with structure analysis settings
   - Added platform-specific scraping options
   - Updated directory structure for better organization

4. **Documentation and Setup**
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - Created a helper script for setting up the directory structure
   - Updated .gitignore to properly exclude generated files

## Recently Completed

1. **Platform-Specific Structure Files**
   - Created `tripadvisor_structure.json` with selectors and anti-bot patterns
   - Created `yelp_structure.json` with enhanced anti-bot detection measures
   - Created `google_structure.json` with specific DOM selectors and behavior patterns (April 10, 2025)
   - Developed a comprehensive schema for structure files including selectors, anti-bot patterns, behavior patterns, and fingerprinting configurations

2. **Unified Structure Analysis Framework**
   - Created `structure_analyzer.py` module for analyzing and managing structure files
   - Implemented `StructureManager` class for accessing structure data across different platforms
   - Developed `update_structure.py` script for managing structure files via command line

3. **Integration with Scraper**
   - Implemented `tripadvisor_structure_scraper.py` that uses the structure files for dynamic selectors
   - Implemented `yelp_structure_scraper.py` with enhanced anti-bot features (April 10, 2025)
   - Implemented `google_structure_scraper.py` with maps-specific adaptations (April 10, 2025)
   - Updated `main.py` to use all structure-based scrapers (April 10, 2025)
   - Added support for applying fingerprinting settings from structure files
   - Integrated human-like behavior patterns from structure files

## Future Plans

Our next focus areas are:

1. **Enhanced Anti-Bot Features**
   - Implement CAPTCHA detection handlers from structure files
   - Add proxy rotation support based on structure-defined patterns
   - Create sophisticated user behavior simulation for each platform
   - Implement IP rotation on detection

2. **Validation Framework**
   - Create validation script to test structure files against live websites
   - Implement automatic structure updating when selectors fail
   - Add unit tests for structure analyzer and manager
   - Create reporting on structure success rates

3. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Create a dashboard for viewing scraper performance
   - Add visualization for structure analysis results
   - Implement structure editing capabilities
   - Add scheduling and automated scraping
