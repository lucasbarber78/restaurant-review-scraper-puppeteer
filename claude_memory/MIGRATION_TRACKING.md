# Documentation Migration Tracking

This document tracks the progress of migrating content from the old documentation system to the new Claude-iterated memory system.

## Migration Status

| Source Document | Migration Status | Target Documents | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md | 游릭 Completed | core/ai_workflow.md | Complete migration with .claude.json information |
| FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md | 游릭 Completed | core/current_status.md | Migrated as "Strategic Future Enhancements" section |
| NEXT_STEPS.md | 游릭 Completed | core/current_status.md | Migrated current achievements, priorities, and tasks |
| PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md | 游릭 Completed | core/architecture.md, core/requirements.md | Development workflow and best practices distributed |
| PROJECT_SETUP_README.md | 游릭 Completed | archival/implementation/setup.md | Comprehensive setup and installation guide created |

## New Documents Created

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md | 游릭 Completed | Guidelines for maintaining documentation during development |
| api_overview.md | 游릭 Completed | Created comprehensive API documentation in archival/api |
| session_2025-04-27_3.md | 游릭 Completed | Session summary for final migration session |

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating documentation:

1. **Preserve all technical information** - Ensure no technical details are lost
2. **Restructure content** - Organize content according to the 3-tier memory structure
3. **Standardize formatting** - Use the templates established in the Claude Memory Guide
4. **Add metadata** - Include appropriate metadata headers for all documents
5. **Update the memory index** - Add entries to memory_index.json for new documents
6. **Cross-reference documents** - Add links to related documents in each file

## Specialized Templates Progress

| Template Type | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Site-specific scraping strategies | 游릭 Completed | Created as archival/config/site_strategies.md |
| Configuration documentation | 游릭 Completed | Created as archival/config/configuration_guide.md |

## Verification and Cleanup

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Consistent formatting | 游릭 Completed | All documents follow consistent format and style |
| Document links | 游릭 Completed | Verified all cross-references between documents |
| Metadata headers | 游릭 Completed | All documents include proper metadata |
| Memory index updates | 游릭 Completed | Updated memory_index.json with all new documents |
| Core memory completeness | 游릭 Completed | All core memory documents cover essential information |
| Recall memory structure | 游릭 Completed | Session summaries properly document project history |
| Archival organization | 游릭 Completed | Archival documents properly organized by component |

## Migration Complete

The migration from the traditional documentation approach to the Claude-iterated memory system is now complete. All source documents have been migrated, and the memory system is fully operational.

The system now consists of:
- 5 core memory documents
- 3 recall memory session summaries
- 10+ archival memory technical documents
- Complete cross-referencing and indexing

The system is ready for ongoing development and can be maintained using the guidelines in DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md.
