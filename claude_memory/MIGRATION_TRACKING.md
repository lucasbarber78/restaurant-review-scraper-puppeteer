# Documentation Migration Tracking

This document tracks the progress of migrating content from the old documentation system to the new Claude-iterated memory system.

## Migration Status

| Source Document | Migration Status | Target Documents | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | core/ai_workflow.md | Partial migration completed |
| FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md | ðŸ”´ Not Started | core/current_status.md, archival/implementation/* | Needs to be distributed to relevant documents |
| NEXT_STEPS.md | ðŸ”´ Not Started | core/current_status.md | Priority tasks need to be extracted |
| PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md | ðŸ”´ Not Started | core/architecture.md, core/requirements.md | Requirements and architecture information needed |
| PROJECT_SETUP_README.md | ðŸ”´ Not Started | archival/implementation/setup.md, archival/config/installation.md | Setup instructions need to be migrated |

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating documentation:

1. **Preserve all technical information** - Ensure no technical details are lost
2. **Restructure content** - Organize content according to the 3-tier memory structure
3. **Standardize formatting** - Use the templates established in the Claude Memory Guide
4. **Add metadata** - Include appropriate metadata headers for all documents
5. **Update the memory index** - Add entries to memory_index.json for new documents
6. **Cross-reference documents** - Add links to related documents in each file

## Specialized Templates Progress

| Template Type | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Site-specific scraping strategies | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Template needed for each review site |
| Configuration documentation | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Documentation for configuration options |
| Testing and validation procedures | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Test suite documentation |
| Archival READMEs | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Directory-specific guidance needed |

## Archival Document Progress

| Document | Status | Notes |

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md content
2. Create the core archival documents listed above
3. Create specialized templates for site-specific strategies
4. Set up README files for archival directories
5. Update memory_index.json with new documents
