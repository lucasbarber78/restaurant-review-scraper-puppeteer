# Current Project Status

## Overview

This document provides a snapshot of the Restaurant Review Scraper project's current development status, recent progress, and upcoming priorities. It is regularly updated to reflect the evolving state of the project.

## Project Phase

**Current Phase**: Initial Development

The project is currently in the initial development phase, with focus on establishing the core architecture and implementing basic functionality. The memory system conversion is underway, moving from a traditional documentation approach to the Claude-iterated memory system.

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Scraper Engine | In Progress | Basic browser control implemented, navigation functionality in development |
| Anti-Bot Module | Research | Investigating effective techniques, prototype implementation planned |
| Data Extraction | Initial Design | Selector strategies defined, implementation pending |
| Proxy Management | Not Started | Planned for development after core scraping functionality |
| Configuration System | Partially Implemented | Basic config structure in place, needs expansion |
| Results Storage | Initial Design | Data structures defined, implementation pending |

## Recent Progress

1. **Memory System Migration**
   - Converted project to use Claude-iterated memory architecture
   - Established three-tier memory structure
   - Created core documentation templates
   - Developed memory index system

2. **Core Scraper**
   - Implemented basic Puppeteer browser automation
   - Created initial browser control abstraction
   - Implemented simple page navigation functions

3. **Configuration**
   - Established configuration file structure
   - Implemented basic configuration loading
   - Created client data schema

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on:

1. **Completing Memory System Migration**
   - Finalizing memory structure
   - Migrating existing documentation into new format
   - Creating specialized templates for scraper components

2. **Core Scraper Enhancement**
   - Implementing reliable navigation mechanisms
   - Adding session persistence
   - Developing error recovery capabilities

3. **Anti-Bot Implementation**
   - Researching effective anti-detection techniques
   - Implementing browser fingerprint randomization
   - Developing human-like behavior simulation

## Known Issues

1. **Browser Detection**
   - Current implementation vulnerable to basic bot detection
   - Fingerprinting countermeasures not yet implemented
   - Solution: Implement the planned Anti-Bot Module

2. **Navigation Reliability**
   - Intermittent failures during page navigation
   - Timing issues with dynamic content loading
   - Solution: Improve wait strategies and add retry mechanisms

3. **Configuration Flexibility**
   - Limited support for site-specific selectors
   - Need more robust configuration validation
   - Solution: Enhance configuration system with validation

## Next Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Memory System Completion | 2025-05-10 | Complete memory system migration with all templates |
| Core Scraper v0.1 | 2025-05-20 | Functional core scraper with basic navigation and extraction |
| Anti-Bot Basic Features | 2025-06-01 | Implement fundamental anti-detection measures |
| First Test Site Integration | 2025-06-15 | Complete integration with first target review site |

## Resource Allocation

- **Development**: 2 developers (1 full-time, 1 part-time)
- **Technical Writing**: Using Claude-iterated memory system
- **Testing**: Developer testing, automated test development planned

## Blockers and Dependencies

- No critical blockers currently identified
- External dependency on Puppeteer development and updates
- Reliance on current site structures for selector development
