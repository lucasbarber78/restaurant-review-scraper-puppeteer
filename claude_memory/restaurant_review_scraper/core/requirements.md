# Project Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Restaurant Review Scraper project. These requirements guide development priorities and serve as criteria for evaluating the success of the project.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Extraction

1. **Review Content**
   - Must extract full text of reviews
   - Must capture review ratings (numeric and/or star-based)
   - Must extract review dates
   - Must capture reviewer information when available (name/username)
   - Should extract review helpfulness metrics when available
   - Should identify and extract review response content when available

2. **Restaurant Information**
   - Must extract restaurant name
   - Must capture restaurant location/address
   - Must extract overall rating
   - Should capture restaurant categories/cuisine types
   - Should extract basic restaurant metadata (price range, hours, etc.)
   - Could extract menu information if available

3. **Navigation and Pagination**
   - Must support navigation through paginated review lists
   - Must handle dynamically loaded content (infinite scroll, "Show More" buttons)
   - Must support extraction from multiple restaurants in a single run
   - Should track scraping progress for resumability

### Anti-Detection Features

1. **Browser Fingerprinting**
   - Must randomize or mask browser fingerprints
   - Must provide configurable user agent rotation
   - Must handle common browser fingerprinting detection methods
   - Should implement canvas/WebGL fingerprinting countermeasures

2. **Request Behavior**
   - Must implement variable timing between requests
   - Must simulate human-like navigation patterns
   - Must support random mouse movements and scrolling behavior
   - Should avoid predictable request patterns

3. **Proxy Management**
   - Must support use of proxy servers
   - Must implement proxy rotation strategies
   - Must detect and handle proxy failures
   - Should support residential proxy integration

### Configuration and Output

1. **Configurability**
   - Must provide configuration for target sites and URLs
   - Must allow customization of scraping parameters (delay, retry policy)
   - Must support site-specific selector configurations
   - Should provide a configuration validation mechanism

2. **Output Options**
   - Must support JSON output format
   - Must support CSV output format
   - Should provide options for data filtering and transformation
   - Could support direct database export

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

1. **Efficiency**
   - Must handle at least 1,000 reviews per hour under normal conditions
   - Should minimize resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
   - Should implement parallel processing where appropriate

2. **Reliability**
   - Must achieve at least 95% success rate in data extraction
   - Must implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Must maintain data integrity across failures
   - Should provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Maintainability

1. **Code Quality**
   - Must follow consistent coding standards
   - Must include comprehensive inline documentation
   - Must implement modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Should include unit tests for core components

2. **Adaptability**
   - Must support easy addition of new target sites
   - Must be resistant to minor site layout changes
   - Should provide a simple interface for updating selectors
   - Should implement automated selector validation

### Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Must not store sensitive credentials in plaintext
   - Should implement secure handling of proxy credentials
   - Should support secure storage of extracted data

2. **Compliance**
   - Must respect robots.txt directives when configured to do so
   - Must implement configurable rate limiting
   - Should support ethical scraping practices

## Technical Constraints

1. **Environment**
   - Must run on Node.js v16 or higher
   - Must work on both Windows and Linux environments
   - Should support containerized deployment

2. **Dependencies**
   - Must use Puppeteer as the primary browser automation tool
   - Should minimize external dependencies
   - Should use widely supported and maintained libraries

3. **Integration**
   - Must provide programmatic API for integration
   - Should support command-line interface
   - Could provide hooks for event-based integration

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if it:

1. Successfully extracts review data from the target sites with at least 95% accuracy
2. Avoids detection and blocking during extended scraping sessions
3. Provides clean, structured data in the specified output formats
4. Can be easily configured and maintained for different scraping scenarios
5. Demonstrates resilience to common failure scenarios
6. Operates within the ethical and legal boundaries of web scraping
