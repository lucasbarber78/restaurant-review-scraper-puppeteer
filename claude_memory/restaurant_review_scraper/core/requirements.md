# Project Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Restaurant Review Scraper project. These requirements guide development priorities and serve as criteria for evaluating the success of the project.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Extraction

1. **Review Content**

   - Must capture reviewer information when available (name/username)
   - Should extract review helpfulness metrics when available
   - Should identify and extract review response content when available

2. **Restaurant Information**
   - Must extract restaurant name
   - Must capture restaurant location/address
   - Must extract overall rating
   - Should capture restaurant categories/cuisine types
   - Should extract basic restaurant metadata (price range, hours, etc.)
   - Could extract menu information if available

3. **Navigation and Pagination**
   - Must support navigation through paginated review lists
   - Must handle dynamically loaded content (infinite scroll, "Show More" buttons)
   - Must support extraction from multiple restaurants in a single run
   - Should track scraping progress for resumability

### Anti-Detection Features

1. **Browser Fingerprinting**
   - Must randomize or mask browser fingerprints
   - Must provide configurable user agent rotation
   - Must handle common browser fingerprinting detection methods
   - Should implement canvas/WebGL fingerprinting countermeasures

2. **Request Behavior**
   - Must implement variable timing between requests
   - Must simulate human-like navigation patterns
   - Must support random mouse movements and scrolling behavior
   - Should avoid predictable request patterns

3. **Proxy Management**
   - Must support use of proxy servers
   - Must implement proxy rotation strategies
   - Must detect and handle proxy failures
   - Should support residential proxy integration

### Configuration and Output

1. **Configurability**
   - Must provide configuration for target sites and URLs
   - Must allow customization of scraping parameters (delay, retry policy)
   - Must support site-specific selector configurations
   - Should provide a configuration validation mechanism

2. **Output Options**
   - Must support JSON output format
   - Must support CSV output format
   - Should provide options for data filtering and transformation
   - Could support direct database export

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

1. **Efficiency**
   - Must handle at least 1,000 reviews per hour under normal conditions
   - Should minimize resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
   - Should implement parallel processing where appropriate

2. **Reliability**
   - Must achieve at least 95% success rate in data extraction
   - Must implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Must maintain data integrity across failures
   - Should provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Maintainability

1. **Code Quality**
   - Must follow consistent coding standards
   - Must include comprehensive inline documentation
   - Must implement modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Should include unit tests for core components

2. **Adaptability**
   - Must support easy addition of new target sites
   - Must be resistant to minor site layout changes
   - Should provide a simple interface for updating selectors
   - Should implement automated selector validation

### Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Must not store sensitive credentials in plaintext
   - Should implement secure handling of proxy credentials
   - Should support secure storage of extracted data

2. **Compliance**
   - Must respect robots.txt directives when configured to do so
   - Must implement configurable rate limiting
   - Should support ethical scraping practices

## Technical Constraints

1. **Environment**
   - Must run on Node.js v16 or higher
   - Must work on both Windows and Linux environments
   - Should support containerized deployment

2. **Dependencies**
   - Must use Puppeteer as the primary browser automation tool
   - Should minimize external dependencies
   - Should use widely supported and maintained libraries

3. **Integration**
   - Must provide programmatic API for integration
   - Should support command-line interface
   - Could provide hooks for event-based integration

## Best Practices Requirements

### Web Scraping Best Practices

1. **Ethical Scraping**
   - Must respect robots.txt files when configured to do so
   - Must implement appropriate rate limiting to avoid server overload
   - Should avoid scraping data marked as private or non-public
   - Should respect the terms of service of target sites where applicable

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Must implement appropriate delays between requests
   - Should use stealth plugins to avoid detection
   - Should consider rotating user agents and proxies
   - Must optimize resource usage during scraping operations

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Must maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures
   - Must document all scraper interactions and data extraction patterns
   - Should implement data validation and error checking
   - Should handle edge cases and unexpected data formats

### Error Handling Requirements

1. **Robust Error Management**
   - Must use try/except blocks around network operations
   - Must implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Must handle site structure changes gracefully
   - Must implement appropriate error logging
   - Should provide detailed debug information for troubleshooting

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Must support graceful recovery from failures
   - Should maintain partial results in case of interruptions
   - Should implement session persistence for long-running operations
   - Must handle browser crashes and restarts seamlessly

### Puppeteer-Specific Requirements

1. **Browser Management**
   - Must use appropriate selectors (prefer data attributes over CSS classes)
   - Must implement proper page lifecycle management
   - Must minimize resource usage during operation
   - Must handle browser crashes and restarts
   - Should implement efficient memory management

2. **Anti-Detection Requirements**
   - Must implement stealth plugins to avoid detection
   - Must simulate human-like behavior
   - Must implement random delays between actions
   - Should randomize scrolling and navigation patterns
   - Should implement browser fingerprinting countermeasures

### API Development Requirements

If API endpoints are implemented:

1. **API Design**
   - Must use FastAPI for any REST API endpoints
   - Must document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Must implement proper validation using Pydantic models
   - Must use appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Must implement proper authentication and authorization

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Must store secrets securely (use environment variables or secure vaults)
   - Must implement input validation
   - Must use parameterized queries for any database interactions
   - Must implement proper authentication for API access
   - Must log security-relevant events

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if it:

1. Successfully extracts review data from the target sites with at least 95% accuracy
2. Avoids detection and blocking during extended scraping sessions
3. Provides clean, structured data in the specified output formats
4. Can be easily configured and maintained for different scraping scenarios
5. Demonstrates resilience to common failure scenarios
6. Operates within the ethical and legal boundaries of web scraping
