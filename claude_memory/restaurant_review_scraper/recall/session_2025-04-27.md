# Session Summary: 2025-04-27

## Key Points Discussed

- Converting the restaurant-review-scraper-puppeteer repository to use the Claude-iterated memory system
- Need to replicate the same three-tier memory architecture from project-instruction-system
- Requirements for the memory system implementation
- Structure and organization of the memory system
- Initial implementation plan divided into three sessions

## Decisions Made

- Adopt the three-tier memory architecture: Core, Recall, and Archival
- Implement exact directory structure and file formatting from the reference repository
- Create a restaurant-specific memory index to organize documentation
- Develop specialized documentation templates for scraper-specific topics
- Implement the conversion in stages, with focus on core structure first

## Technical Details

- Created the directory structure for the memory system:
  - `claude_memory/` - Root directory for the memory system
  - `claude_memory/restaurant_review_scraper/` - Project-specific memory
  - `claude_memory/restaurant_review_scraper/core/` - Core memory
  - `claude_memory/restaurant_review_scraper/recall/` - Recall memory
  - `claude_memory/restaurant_review_scraper/archival/` - Archival memory

- Implemented core memory documents:
  - `project_overview.md` - High-level project description
  - `architecture.md` - System architecture documentation
  - `requirements.md` - Functional and non-functional requirements
  - `current_status.md` - Current project status and milestones
  - `ai_workflow.md` - Guidelines for using Claude with the project

- Created the memory index at `claude_memory/memory_index.json` with:
  - Topics mapping to relevant documents
  - Document metadata and keywords
  - Component groupings
  - Common query mappings

- Created CLAUDE_MEMORY_GUIDE.md in the root directory as a reference guide

## Open Questions

- How best to migrate existing documentation from the old format to the new memory system?
- What specialized archival memory categories are needed for the restaurant review scraper?
- How to optimize the memory index for restaurant review scraper specific workflows?
- What additional templates are needed for specialized scraper documentation?

## Next Steps

- Create template archival memory documents for key components
- Migrate existing technical information into the memory system
- Create specialized templates for scraper-specific documentation
- Implement sample archival memory documents
- Update README.md to reflect the new memory system

## Artifacts to Archive

- Core Memory Templates - Already implemented in core/
- Recall Memory Template - Already implemented in recall/
- Memory Index Structure - Created at memory_index.json
- Implementation Guide - Created as CLAUDE_MEMORY_GUIDE.md
