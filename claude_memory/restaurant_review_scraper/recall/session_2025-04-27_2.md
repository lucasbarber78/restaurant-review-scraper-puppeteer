# Session Summary: 2025-04-27 (Session 2)

## Key Points Discussed

- Continuation of migrating documentation to the Claude-iterated memory system
- Creating specialized archival documents for key components
- Developing templates for site-specific scraping strategies and configuration
- Adding subdirectory READMEs to provide guidance on documentation organization
- Tracking migration progress with a dedicated document
- Updating the memory index to include new documents

## Decisions Made

- Created a structured migration tracking document to monitor progress
- Developed comprehensive archival documentation for key components:
  - Scraper design
  - Data processing
  - Proxy management
  - Browser fingerprinting
- Created specialized templates for site-specific strategies and configuration
- Established READMEs for archival subdirectories
- Updated the memory index with new documents and relationships

## Technical Details

- Created `scraper_design.md` with detailed architecture documentation
- Created `data_processing.md` with extraction and processing details
- Created `proxy_management.md` with rotation strategies
- Created `browser_fingerprinting.md` with anti-detection techniques
- Created `site_strategies.md` with platform-specific implementation details
- Created `configuration_guide.md` with comprehensive configuration options
- Created `testing_validation.md` with testing procedures
- Added READMEs for API and Config subdirectories
- Updated `memory_index.json` to include all new documents

## Open Questions

- How to handle the remaining content in AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md?
- What is the best way to distribute content from FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md?
- Should we create additional specialized templates for other categories?
- How to integrate the migrated documentation with development workflows?

## Next Steps

- Complete the migration of remaining content from old documentation files:
  - AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
  - FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md
  - NEXT_STEPS.md
  - PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - PROJECT_SETUP_README.md
- Create any remaining archival documents needed
- Finalize integration with development processes
- Create tools or scripts for memory maintenance
- Test the documentation structure with example queries

## Artifacts to Archive

- Migration tracking document - Stored in claude_memory directory
- Archival templates for key components - Stored in archival/implementation
- Site-specific strategy templates - Stored in archival/config
- Documentation guidelines in READMEs - Stored in respective directories
- Updated memory index - Stored in claude_memory directory
