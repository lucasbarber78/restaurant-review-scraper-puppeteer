# Scraper Design

## Purpose

This document outlines the architectural design of the restaurant review scraper system, including the core components, their interactions, and the overall system architecture. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding how the scraper is structured and how its various components work together.

## System Architecture

### Overview

The restaurant review scraper is built as a modular, extensible system with the following key components:

1. **Core Scraper Framework**: The central coordination system that manages the scraping process
2. **Platform-Specific Scrapers**: Specialized modules for each review platform (TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google)
3. **Anti-Bot Protection Layer**: Mechanisms to avoid detection while scraping
4. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Transforms raw scraping results into structured review data
5. **Multi-Client Management System**: Handles configuration and data for multiple restaurant clients
6. **Proxy Management**: Rotates and manages proxy connections to avoid IP blocking
7. **Structure Analysis**: Monitors and adapts to changes in website structures

### Component Diagram

The system follows this high-level component architecture:

          └────────────────┤ - Config Management     │
                           │ - Client Data Storage   │
                           └─────────────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Scraper Framework

The main controller coordinates the entire scraping process:

1. **Initialization**: Loads configurations, sets up logging, initializes browser instances
2. **Job Scheduling**: Determines which platforms to scrape for which clients
3. **Execution Management**: Runs platform-specific scrapers with appropriate settings
4. **Result Aggregation**: Combines results from different platforms
5. **Error Handling**: Manages and recovers from errors during scraping

### Platform-Specific Scrapers

Each platform-specific scraper implements a common interface but uses specialized techniques:

```javascript
// Common interface for all platform scrapers
class PlatformScraper {
  constructor(config, browser) {
    this.config = config;
    this.browser = browser;
  }

  async initialize() {
    // Platform-specific initialization
  }

  async scrapeReviews(options) {
    // Platform-specific implementation
  }

  async navigateToReviews() {
    // Platform-specific navigation
  }

  async extractReviewData(page) {
    // Platform-specific extraction
  }

  async cleanup() {
    // Clean up resources
  }
}
```

### Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. **Configuration Input**: Read from config.yaml and clients.json
2. **Scraping Execution**: Platform scrapers extract raw HTML and page data
3. **Data Extraction**: Raw page data is converted to structured review objects
4. **Processing Pipeline**: Reviews are categorized, analyzed for sentiment, and enriched with metadata
5. **Output Generation**: Processed reviews are exported to CSV files organized by client

## Design Principles

The scraper architecture adheres to the following design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility and well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: New review platforms can be added without changing the core structure
3. **Resilience**: The system can recover from failures during scraping
4. **Configurability**: Behavior can be modified through configuration without code changes
5. **Maintainability**: Structure analysis helps adapt to website changes

## Key Algorithms

### Review Pagination Handling

The system uses a dynamic pagination approach:

1. Identify pagination pattern for the current platform
2. Extract total review count and calculate number of pages
3. Implement appropriate click/scroll mechanism to load more reviews
4. Track already processed reviews to avoid duplicates
5. Implement delay strategies between page loads to avoid detection

### Anti-Bot Measures

The anti-bot subsystem uses multiple layers of protection:

1. Human-like browser fingerprinting
2. Variable timing between actions
3. Natural mouse movement patterns
4. Random behavioral variations
5. Proxy rotation based on request patterns

## Dependencies

- **Puppeteer**: Core browser automation
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries**: For categorization and sentiment analysis
