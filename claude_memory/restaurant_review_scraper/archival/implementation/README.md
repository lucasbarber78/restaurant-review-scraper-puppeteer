# Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed technical documentation about the implementation of the restaurant review scraper. It focuses on code structure, design patterns, algorithms, and the technical decisions that shaped the system.

## Purpose

The implementation documentation serves to:

1. Explain the technical architecture and code organization
2. Document key algorithms and data structures
3. Detail the anti-bot measures and their implementation
4. Describe data processing and extraction methods
5. Provide technical reference for developers

## How to Use This Section

### For New Developers

If you are new to the project:

1. Start with [scraper_design.md](scraper_design.md) to understand the overall architecture
2. Read the [data_processing.md](data_processing.md) document to learn how data flows through the system
3. Familiarize yourself with the [anti_bot_measures.md](anti_bot_measures.md) to understand the security aspects

### For Contributors

If you are contributing to the project:

1. Check the relevant implementation documents for the area you are modifying
2. Follow the established patterns and techniques documented here
3. Update documentation when making significant changes to the implementation
4. Read [testing_strategies.md](testing_strategies.md) before modifying code

### For Technical Leads

If you are overseeing technical aspects:

1. Use these documents to understand technical debt and system constraints
2. Refer to [performance_optimization.md](performance_optimization.md) for scaling considerations
3. Consider the error handling and resilience strategies documented in [error_handling.md](error_handling.md)

## Key Technical Topics

### Scraper Architecture

The scraper is built with a modular architecture allowing for:

- Platform-independent core functionality
- Platform-specific modules for each review site
- Configurable anti-bot protection
- Pluggable data processing pipeline
- Multi-client support

Key design patterns include:

- Strategy pattern for platform-specific implementations
- Factory pattern for browser instance creation
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Decorator pattern for enhancing browser capabilities

### Anti-Bot Techniques

The scraper employs several anti-bot detection techniques:

- Advanced browser fingerprinting (see [browser_fingerprinting.md](browser_fingerprinting.md))
- Human-like behavior simulation
- Proxy rotation (see [proxy_management.md](proxy_management.md))
- Request pattern randomization
- Header and cookie management

### Data Processing

The data processing pipeline includes:

- DOM parsing and element extraction
- Text normalization and cleaning
- Date parsing and standardization
- Review categorization
- Sentiment analysis
- Data export and storage

### Testing and Quality Assurance

The testing strategies include:

- Unit testing for core components
- Integration testing for end-to-end flows
- Visual regression testing for site changes
- Performance benchmarking
- Anti-detection testing

## Code Examples

Each implementation document includes relevant code snippets to illustrate the concepts. These are meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive and may not reflect the exact implementation in the current codebase.

## Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

The documentation includes discussions of key technical decisions and their trade-offs, such as:

- Browser automation vs. API approaches
- Headless vs. headful browser operation
- Performance vs. detection avoidance
- Data quality vs. scraping speed
- Memory usage vs. data processing capabilities

## Additions and Updates

When adding new implementation documentation or updating existing documents:

1. Follow the established format with clear sections
2. Include code examples where relevant
3. Document design patterns and algorithms
4. Explain the rationale behind technical decisions
5. Update version history when making significant changes
