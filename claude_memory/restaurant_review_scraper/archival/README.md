# Archival Memory

This directory contains detailed technical documentation for the Restaurant Review Scraper project, organized by component or category.

## Purpose

Archival memory stores comprehensive technical information that may be too detailed for core memory but is essential for understanding specific components or implementations.

## Structure

Archival memory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **api/**: API endpoints and client implementations
- **config/**: Configuration management and settings
- **implementation/**: Implementation details for various components
  - **scraper_design.md**: Overall scraper architecture
  - **anti_bot_measures.md**: Techniques for avoiding detection
  - **data_processing.md**: Data extraction and formatting
  - **proxy_management.md**: Proxy rotation and configuration

## Usage

When implementing or modifying specific components, Claude will reference and update the relevant archival memory documents. These documents should contain detailed technical information, examples, and implementation notes.

Archival memory documents are created and updated as needed during development, either proactively by Claude or upon request.
